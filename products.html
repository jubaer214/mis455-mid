                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Long before the adidas Samba shoes took to the streets, they left their mark on the indoor football pitch. Their smooth leather upper, nubuck toe cap and reinforced rubber sole were designed with agility and control in mind. Though times have changed, their essence remains. Today, they carry on the legacy as an iconic street style, ready for whatever your day brings. Molded into their design is decades of history, keeping the spirit of the Trefoil alive.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>It wouldn't be a list of adidas' most iconic shoes without the Gazelle. First worn on indoor courts in the '70s, the suede shoe is gaining new fans to this day. Now the style you covet is lifted up to new heights. It's stacked three layers high, for a new perspective on the classic style. The details stay sporty with buttery-soft suede and serrated 3-Stripes. A metallic-gold "Gazelle" is the final stamp of our heritage.</p>
